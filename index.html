              <p>Hi, friend! I am Isa, a born and raised Californian pursuing a computer science degree in 
                Seattle, Washington. What a mouthful right? Essentially I spend around nine months in Seattle
                and three beautiful summery months in my home city of San Jose. For non-californians that 
                would be somewhere near the Bay Area. For Bay Area locals that would be the last major city 
                before entering central valley on your way to Disneyland hahaha. Any who, I’ve created this 
                website as a way to document my life, thoughts, and accomplishments. To be able to keep for 
                my future self, but also as a means to allow family and friends to keep up with my life when 
                I am traveling back and forth. I hope you enjoy this little snippet of my brain.</p>
